# CoffeeScript syntax highlighting for Notepad++
***


Will syntax highlight files with extensions of coffee, coco, and CAKEFILE using Notepad++'s user-defined language(within its limits).

## Deployment


1. If you don't have an userDefineLang.xml file already, you can drop this file among your other configuration file, in the Notepad++ Install Folder. It should be named userDefineLang.xml.
2. Otherwise, open both the existing and new file.
    - Select all of the new file, copy, and paste at the end of the current file.
    - This should have created a spurious </Notepad_Plus><Notepad_plus> pair in the middle, each tag on a line by itself. Remove these two consecutive lines.
    - Close Notepad++.


Your Languages menu should show the newly added language at the bottom, next time you launch Notepad++.
